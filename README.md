This project is a clone of my college's website. It is not the full implementation but rather an understanding of layout of the website. I have not implemented much animations compared to the original but made some areas of the website more responsive than the original. 

Link to the original website is here - https://srkit.edu.in/index.html

After downloading the project zip file, extract it.
Double click the "home.html" to open the main page of the cloned website in your default web browser.
Not all the sections from the original website are implemented in my clone.
From home page, various other pages can be accessed through navbar and other elements.
Obviously all links mentioned in the website won't work. They are placed to act as placeholders.

To test the responsiveness of the website click "ctrl+shift+i" on your keyword to open dev tools console.
Here, you can check the website's reponsiveness by changing the screen size/resolution.
Comparing the responsiveness of the websites will let you understand the difference between the original website and my clone.

Thank you for checking out!
